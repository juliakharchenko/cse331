Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

Other than making changes based on converting my graph ADT to support generics, I removed the implementation
of my comparable interface on my Node class which was causing some issues when dealing with graphs with nodes
of type Point in CampusMap.java since Point doesn't implement Comparable. Since I needed to make sure sorting worked
in the test driver in hw-graph, hw-marvel, and hw-pathfinder, I created a NodeComparator (similar to my EdgeComparator
class) static inner class in all of those files to handle sorting a list of nodes of type String.
