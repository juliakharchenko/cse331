# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm between two nodes
# that have nodes connected between them.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 7.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 4.000 from C to D in simpleGraph

path from A to D:
A to B with weight 10.000
B to C with weight 7.000
C to D with weight 4.000
total cost: 21.000
