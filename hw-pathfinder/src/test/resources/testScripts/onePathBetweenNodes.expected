# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm between
# two nodes where only one path exists between them.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 5.000 from B to C in simpleGraph

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 10.000
total cost: 10.000
path from B to C:
B to C with weight 5.000
total cost: 5.000
