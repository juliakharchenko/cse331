# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm where the
# shortest path between two nodes is different
# before rounding and after rounding

created graph roundedGraph

added node A to roundedGraph
added node B to roundedGraph
added node C to roundedGraph

added edge 3.778 from A to B in roundedGraph
added edge 4.117 from B to C in roundedGraph
added edge 7.895 from A to C in roundedGraph

path from A to C:
A to B with weight 3.778
B to C with weight 4.117
total cost: 7.895
