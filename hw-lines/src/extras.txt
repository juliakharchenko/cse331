Describe any additional functionality you added to your application, or any
significant changes you made to the starter code beyond the basic requirements
of the assignment, below:

Additional functionality that I added to my application was the ability to enter
in coordinates of a point and that point being displayed onto the map. This was one
of the extra credit options that I implemented. In order to do this I created a
Point interface to represent a single point and a PointList class (similar to EdgeList)
that allows users to input points into a text field and stores the information about that
point. I also created an Edge interface to represent an edge with the coordinates of the ends
of the point and the color of the edge. This was implemented in my EdgeList class whose prop
represented an array of Edges. Other than that no significant changes were made.
