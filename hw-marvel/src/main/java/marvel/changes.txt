Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel, and why you made those changes.

Aside from some minor specification changes based on the feedback that I received from hw5-part2, I didn't
make any changes to my graph class. The specification changes was removing spec.modifies in the constructor,
adding javadoc comments to global variables, some stronger method header comments, and moving a for loop in
my checkRep inside the debug if statement to improve run time. Other than this, no actual implementation
changes were made.
