# Tests if multiple nodes can be added to the graph

# Create a graph
created graph multiNodeGraph

# Add nodes
added node a to multiNodeGraph
added node b to multiNodeGraph

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from a and b
multiNodeGraph contains: a b
the children of a in multiNodeGraph are:
the children of b in multiNodeGraph are:
