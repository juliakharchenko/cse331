# Tests that a reflexive edge can be added

# Create a graph
created graph reflexiveGraph

# Add a Node
added node n1 to reflexiveGraph

# Add an Edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in reflexiveGraph

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
reflexiveGraph contains: n1
the children of n1 in reflexiveGraph are: n1(e1)
