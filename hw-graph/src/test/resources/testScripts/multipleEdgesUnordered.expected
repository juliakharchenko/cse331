# Tests if edges are printed in alphabetical order

# Create a graph
created graph multiEdgeGraph

# Add nodes
added node a to multiEdgeGraph
added node b to multiEdgeGraph

# Add edges
added edge AB2 from a to b in multiEdgeGraph
added edge AB1 from a to b in multiEdgeGraph
added edge BA2 from b to a in multiEdgeGraph
added edge BA1 from b to a in multiEdgeGraph

# Prints the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from a and b
multiEdgeGraph contains: a b
the children of a in multiEdgeGraph are: b(AB1) b(AB2)
the children of b in multiEdgeGraph are: a(BA1) a(BA2)
