# Tests if two nodes in a graph can have an edge pointing from node 1 to node 2 and
# an edge pointing from node 2 to node 1

# Create a graph
created graph twoNodeGraph

# Add nodes
added node a to twoNodeGraph
added node b to twoNodeGraph

# Add edges
added edge AB from a to b in twoNodeGraph
added edge BA from b to a in twoNodeGraph

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from a and b
twoNodeGraph contains: a b
the children of a in twoNodeGraph are: b(AB)
the children of b in twoNodeGraph are: a(BA)
