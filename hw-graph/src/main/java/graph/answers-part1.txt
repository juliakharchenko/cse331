###########################################################################

a. Write an AF and RI for IntQueue1 and IntQueue2.

    ### IntQueue1

    Abstraction Function:
    AF(this): Queue<Integer> q such that
              q = entries = [] if entries is empty
              q = entries = [e0, e1, ... , e(i-1)] where i = size


    Representation Invariant:
    entries != null && entries[i] != null where 0 <= i < entries.size()




    ### IntQueue2

    Abstraction Function:
    AF(this): Queue<Integer> q such that
              entries = [e0, e1, ... , e(i-1)] where i = number of elements in entries
              front = k (index of first element in entries), size = n
              q = entries = [] if size = 0
              q = [e(k), ... , e(k+n-1)] if (front + size) <= entries.length
              q = [e(k), ... , e(i-1), e0, ..., e(n-(i-k)-1)] if (front + size) > entries.length


    Representation Invariant:
    entries != null & 0 <= front <= entries.length - 1 & size >= 0



b. Group the snapshots of IntQueue2's internal state into groups that have the same abstract state.
   Group 1: q(a) = [1,2], q(d) = [1,2], q(g) = [1,2]
   Group 2: q(b) = [2,3,4], q(h) = [2,3,4]
   Group 3: q(c) = [1,2,3], q(f) = [1,2,3]
   Group 4: q(e) = [1,2,3,4]



c. For each signature below, state and justify in 1-2 sentences (per part) whether the method or constructor
could possibly expose the representation, given the information available. Explain any assumptions you made.

    1. `public int solveEquations(int x, int y, int z)`
        There is no representation exposure here since the method returns a new integer
        representing the solved equation given x, y, z. The client cannot modify or interact
        with x, y, and z in anyway.


    2. `public String[] decode(boolean slowly)`
        Since an array is a mutable type, it is possible rep exposure could occur if the String
        array that is returned is a reference to a private field within the class. If a new array
        is returned, then representation exposure does not occur.


    3. `private Date myBirthday()`
        Assuming that Date is mutable, it is possible rep exposure could occur if the Data object
        that is returned is a reference to 'this' Date object in the class. If a new Date object
        is returned, then representation exposure does not occur.


    4. `public String toString()`
        Since String is an immutable type, there is no representation exposure.


    5. `public Iterator<Integer> elements()`
        This method contains representation exposure if the Iterator returned
        is a reference to a mutable collection.


    6. `public Deck(List<Card> cards)`
        This method can have representation exposure if a copy of
        'cards' is not created to construct Deck. If the list of cards
        is not copied, the client can mutate cards within the list since
        List is a mutable data type.



## Part 2

Briefly explain why you included the operations you did and why you feel they are a sufficient
interface to a graph. If your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional classes and why you decided
not to include them.

What was your testing strategy for this assignment? How do your script tests and JUnit tests
differ from each other (if they do), and why?
